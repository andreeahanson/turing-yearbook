# Turing Yearbook

Turing Yearbook is an individual project that was assigned on the first week of learning React. It consists of a yearbook application, where the pictures, the names and the quotes of each of the people in the Turing Staff and Students are rendered on the DOM, using React. There is a form that can be used to add a new student, and it appears by the click of the "Add a student" button at the top of the main page.

This application was built with `create-react-app`.
